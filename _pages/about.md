I currently work as a full-time AI Agent Developer Intern at the Center of Collaborative & Conversational Intelligence (C3I) at Tsinghua University. 

I worked full-time as a visiting researcher for 5 months in 2023 at the Social AI & Robotics Lab (SAIR) at King's College London University. 

I have been a part-time research intern since 2022 for over a year at the Cognitive Robotics and AI Lab (CRAI) at Kent State University.
